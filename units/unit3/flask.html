      <h2 id="running-html">Reminder</h2>
      <p>If you have doubts about HTML, CSS, JS and/or the client-server architecture, please review the 
      <a href="https://albertogilf.github.io/web_server_introduction/units/unit2/deployinghtml.html"> previous lesson</a> </p>
      <p>At this point you should be able to create HTML pages, stylize them using CSS and run code in the browser with JavaScript. 
      Clients send requests to the servers, the servers processes the requests and send responses to the clients, that display them. 
      The web servers usually respond by sending HTML, CSS and Javascript. The response is then handled by the browser, that 
      runs the JavaScript code, displays the HTML and uses the CSS to style the HTML. If you are loose when you read this paragraph, 
      run to the previous lesson and review it!</p>

      <p>Remember also the python programming learnt in the previous lessons. It will provide us with the basic knowledge to know what 
      the Flask web server is doing. The source runs strong with a consolidated knowledge :)</p>
      <p>In this lesson we will use repl.it, since it allows us to host a server in their hosting service, so we will be able to 
      deploy our web pages using their hosting!</p>

      <h2 id="client-side-code">Serving HTML content. The source awakens</h2>
      
      <iframe height="500px" width="100%" src="https://repl.it/@AlbertoGil/flask-test?lite=true" 
      scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allowtransparency="true" 
      allowfullscreen="true" sandbox="allow-forms allow-pointer-lock allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-modals"></iframe>

      <p>Take a look in the code from repl.it. Open it in a full screen, clicking in the top right corner (open in repl.it) button 
      or navigating to <a href="https://repl.it/@AlbertoGil/flask-test">https://repl.it/@AlbertoGil/flask-test</a>. 
      Check out the different files there:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>main.py: Server-side code where the server runs its code</li>
        <li>static: folder where the html pages to be served from the web server are allocated. It contains the lib folder where the .css and .js 
        files are stored. They are sent to the client as well.</li>
        <li>templates: similar to the previous folder, but it contains templates instead of static pages. Templates are usually used as a base 
        to create HTML web pages. When we return the output of the template (using the function <code>render_template</code>, we send the corresponding 
        file, but all the variables under curly braces <code>{{variable}}</code> are checked. If we give information about this variable 
        in the request, it gets replaced by its value. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The served content can be accesed clicking the <img src="popout.png" width="20" alt="popout"/> button or navigating to 
      <a href="https://flask-test.albertogil.repl.co">https://flask-test.albertogil.repl.co</a>.</p>
      <p>Now navigate to the	<code>/goodbye</code> on the end. What do you see? How do you think python generates what you see?</p>

    <h2 id="assignments">
    Flask functions</h2>
    <ul>
    <li><strong><code>@app.route('{route}')</code></strong>: tt returns to the client whatever it is in the function defined under this directive. 
    </li>
    <li><strong><code>app.send_static_file('{static_file_name}')</code></strong>: it sends the specified file as it is to the client. The client figures out what to do with it.</li>
    <li><strong><code>render_template('{template_name}')</code></strong>: it sends the specified template to the client. Before sending it, it checks all the pairs between 
    curly braces <code>{{variable}}</code> If there is some information about the variables between curly braces, it replace them with the value provided.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="assignments">
    Assignments</h2>
    <p>We want to deploy the amazing HTML web page that we created the previous week. No one wants to miss it :)</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Making our fake news worlwide accesible!
        <ul>
        <li>Create your own web application server copying the files from the <a href="https://flask-test.albertogil.repl.co">repl.it</a> provided 
        and check that it works and it is accesible in the domain assigned by repl.it to your repl.it</li>
        <li>Create different routes that returns different content. Y</li>
        <li>Insert content into the HTML pages so instead of write the routes in the navigation bar of the browser, we can click into the links 
        provided in your HTML page. HINT: Use &lt;a&gt; tags and its corresponding attributes.</li>
        <li>Deploy a template using variables to return with different calls. The template should be called from two different routes named 
        <code>atleti</code> and <code>rayo</code>. Does it display different content in the browser?</li>
        <li>EXTRA. You can make any change to the repl.it apps modifying the .py, .css, .js or .html files! You will see if there is any error when the code is automatically deployed. 
        As long as the website runs, all plays are allowed. Use the source, Luke!</li>
      </ul></li>
    </ol>
