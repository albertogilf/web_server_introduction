## Start the "webapp" Project: Navigating The Terminal
Before creating the webapp project, you should do a few tasks:

1. Download the project from the [Python tutorial repository](https://github.com/alberto.gilf/)
	* Click the "Clone or download" button in the top right corner and "Download Zip"

2. Go to the downloaded file, "unzip" it, and go into the folder. 

3. Please, ask questions about anything that you don't get! 

## Suggested Download for coding: Microsoft Visual Studio Code or SublimeText 2

I suggest that you install Microsoft Visual Studio Code or SublimeText 2, a text editor designed for writing code. 
They provide plugins to highlights reserved words, autocomplete, etc. I suggest to install the Python Extension Pack for Microsoft Visual Studio Code into extensions.
